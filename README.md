I'm a lucky guy! As a solo free-lance web developer, it's always tough to get hired by a world-class business!

That's why I'm honoured to have been hired by [**Fat Slob Plumbing**](https://fat-slob-plumbing.vercel.app/) to build their website!

Ron & Dave are on a mission to save humanity from the horror of a blocked toilet.

Meanwhile, I'm on a mission to leverage TypeScript, Next.js, React, HyGraph, and **pure CSS** to produce the best website possible for Fat Slob Plumbing.

Business is booming - they're franchising!

## React

- I intend to make just about everything a React component, including cards, paragraphs, animations, spacers, and more. Plenty more to do on that.

## Pure CSS

- Why highlight the pure CSS? Because I'm proud of it! Take a look at the responsive design, the functions, and globals.css if you're interested. I've tried hard to write _cascading_ styles which respect HMTL semantics.

## TypeScript

- The goal is no anys at all. Lots to do.

# To Do:

- bookings with "Trish"

- Franchise section

- About Us section: HyGraph, photos, card, text

- e-commerce: Fat Slob Plumbing t-shirts

- logo

- Twitter account, bot, feed, etc
