# Fat Slob Plumbing
<p>I'm a lucky guy!</p>
<p>As a solo freelancer, it's not every day you work with a world-class business!</p>

<p>That's why I'm <strong>honoured</strong> to have been hired by <a href="https://fat-slob-plumbing.vercel.app/">Fat Slob Plumbing</a> to build their website.</p>

</div>

<p align="center"><em>Ron & Dave are on a mission to save humanity from the horror of a blocked toilet.</em></p>
<br/>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm on a mission to leverage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Next.js/React</li>
  <li>TypeScript</li>
  <li>GraphQL</li>
  <li>and good old plain vanilla CSS</li>
</ul>
<p>to produce the best website possible for Fat Slob Plumbing.</p>
<p>It's a pity my graphics card is broken. The colour palette looks different for most people than it does for me.</p>

Fortunately Ron and Dave don't mind about that - business is booming! They're franchising!
