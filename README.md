This is a portfolio project to showcase my TypeScript, Next.js, React, Bootstrap, and copy-writing chops.

# Fat Slob Plumbing

### Stress testing domestic sewage systems since 2013.

Ask yourself: what sort of web-site would a business named "Fat Slob Plumbing" have?

It would probably be quite bad, right? But to their credit, the two guys who own and run Fat Slob Plumbing, Ron & Dave, realised they needed to modernise. So they hired me, Mark Hatherly, to update their site.

I used TypeScript, Next.js, React, and Bootstrap to produce a new website for Fat Slob Plumbing, and guess what? - business has NOT gone down the toilet: quite the reverse, in fact.
