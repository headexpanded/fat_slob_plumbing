# Fat Slob Plumbing

I'm a lucky guy! As a junior web developer, it's tough to land your first free-lance gig.

That's why I'm honoured to have been hired by Fat Slob Plumbing to build their website!

I'm using TypeScript, Next.js, React, HyGraph, and pure CSS to produce a new website for Fat Slob Plumbing.

Business is booming - they're franchising!

Ron & Dave are both life-long Port Vale FC fans, so I've used The Vale's kit for the colour palette, with some secondary colours from The Vale's home page. Funnily enough, the palette nicely matches what Ron & Dave produce on a daily basis at their customer's homes.
