# Fat Slob Plumbing

I'm a lucky guy! As a junior web developer, it's tough to land your first free-lance gig.

That's why I'm honoured to have been hired by Fat Slob Plumbing to build their website!

I'm using TypeScript, Next.js, React, HyGraph, and **pure CSS** to produce a new website for Fat Slob Plumbing.

Business is booming - they're franchising!

## React

- I'm on a mission to make just about everything a React component, including cards, paragraphs, animations, and more. Plenty more to do on that.

## Pure CSS

- Why highlight the pure CSS? Because I'm proud of it! Take a look at globals.css if you're interested ‚Åª I've tried hard to write _cascading_ styles which respect HMTL semantics.

## TypeScript

- Quite a challenge getting it all working properly that's for sure: lots to learn!

# To Do:

- helpful slider ("Trish")

- Franchise section

- About Us section: HyGraph, photos, card, text

- e-commerce: Fat Slob Plumbing t-shirts

- Fat Slob images

- logo

- Twitter account, bot, feed, etc
