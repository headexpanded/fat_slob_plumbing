<p>I'm a lucky guy!</p>
<p>As a solo freelancer, it's not every day you work with a world-class business!</p>

That's why I'm **honoured** to have been hired by [**Fat Slob Plumbing**](https://fat-slob-plumbing.vercel.app/) to build their website.

Ron & Dave are on a mission to save humanity from the horror of a blocked toilet.

Meanwhile, I'm on a mission to leverage:
- TypeScript
- Next.js/React
- GraphQL, and
- pure CSS

to produce the best website possible for Fat Slob Plumbing.

It's a pity my graphics card is broken. The colour palette looks different for most people than it does for me.

Fortunately Ron and Dave don't mind about that - business is booming! They're franchising!

## Next/React

- Next 12.3
- React 18.2

## Vanilla CSS

- responsive design
- no framework

## TypeScript

- strict: true
- noImplicitAnys: true 

## To Do:

- e-commerce: the world needs Fat Slob Plumbing t-shirts

- logo

- Twitter account, bot, feed, etc
