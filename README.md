# Fat Slob Plumbing

I'm a lucky guy! As a junior web developer, it's tough to land your first free-lance gig.

That's why I'm honoured to have been hired by Fat Slob Plumbing to build their website!

I used TypeScript, Next.js, React, and Bootstrap to produce a new website for Fat Slob Plumbing, and guess what? - business has NOT gone down the toilet: quite the reverse, in fact. They're franchising!
