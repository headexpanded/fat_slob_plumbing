# Fat Slob Plumbing

I'm a lucky guy! As a junior web developer, it's tough to land your first free-lance gig.

That's why I'm honoured to have been hired by Fat Slob Plumbing to build their website!

I'm using TypeScript, Next.js, React, HyGraph, and pure CSS to produce a new website for Fat Slob Plumbing.

Business is booming - they're franchising!

- About Us section: HyGraph, photos, card, text
