This is a portfolio project to showcase my TypeScript, Next.js, React, and copy-writing chops.

## Fat Slob Plumbing

Stress testing domestic sewage systems since 2013.

First, ask yourself: what sort of web-site would a business named "Fat Slob Plumbing" have?

So the objective here is to use TypeScript, Next.js, and React to create a web-site which looks and feels like "Fat Slob Plumbing", but in the background has a whole lot of up-to-date code (and some Easter eggs too).
